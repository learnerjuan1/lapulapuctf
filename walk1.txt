A Walk 1 (70)

After the defeat of Magellan, LapuLapu was able to capture one of the ships that was abandoned. 
Searching at the items, a picture of Magellan caught his eye and claimed this as one of his prize. 
Jumping down the ship and walking along the shore . . . 
try your forensics skills if you can investigate the Flag hidden inside Magellan's Picture frame while walking along Lapulapu.
